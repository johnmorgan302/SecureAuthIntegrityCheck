<h1>Secureauth Integrity Check</h1>
This script is intended to run as a daily task.  If necessary,
you can run more often.  If the system detects that a change
has been made to any of the configurations of a realm, it will
enter a message in the Windows Application log.  From there, it
is a simple task to program your SEIM to alert you in the manner
that best suits your organization.
